## Context packs

Before reasoning about the use case, resolve the packs that apply to you:

```bash
poetry run python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/builder/packs.py resolve --for <role> --usecase-dir <usecase-dir>
```

Treat `must` entries as hard constraints: never decide against one, and if the use case cannot be served within it, raise an `open_questions` entry with `caused_by_rule` instead of bending the rule. Treat `should` entries as the default, deviating only with an explicit reason in `rationale`. Mention `may` entries when relevant. Cite every ref that shaped a stage decision in that stage's `constrained_by`. Open a guideline file only when its summary matters to the decision at hand. If the resolver reports an override of a `must`, say so in your record so it lands in `gates.yaml`. With no packs active, the factory defaults apply and your rationale says so.

Full rules: `forjate:context-pack`.
